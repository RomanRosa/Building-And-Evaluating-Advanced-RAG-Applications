## Advanced Techniques and Best Practices Learned

### Enhanced RAG Pipeline Performance

- 📚 **Mastered Sentence-Window Retrieval and Auto-Merging Retrieval**: Learned methods like sentence-window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval, which significantly improved the performance of my Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline beyond the baseline.

### Streamlining Evaluation Processes

- 🔄 **Evaluation Best Practices**: Acquired knowledge in evaluation best practices to streamline the process, enabling me to iteratively build a more robust system.

### Understanding the RAG Triad

- 🔍 **Dived into the RAG Triad for LLM Evaluation**: Explored the RAG triad for evaluating the relevance and truthfulness of a Large Language Model's response, focusing on Context Relevance, Groundedness, and Answer Relevance.

## Key Learnings from the Course on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Course Overview
In this course, I delved into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a prominent use case of large language models (LLMs). I learned how this method facilitates the integration of an LLM with an organization's proprietary data and is crucial for successful RAG implementation.

### Advanced Retrieval Techniques

- 📊 **Sentence-window Retrieval and Auto-merging Retrieval**: I explored two advanced retrieval methods that outperform the baseline RAG pipeline. These techniques include sentence-window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval, which were essential for obtaining coherent contexts.

### Evaluation and Experiment Tracking

- 🔬 **Evaluation and Iterative Improvement**: I learned about evaluation and experiment tracking as a way to evaluate and iteratively improve the RAG pipeline's performance.

### Understanding the RAG Triad

- 💡 **The RAG Triad - Context Relevance, Groundedness, and Answer Relevance**: I studied the RAG triad, comprising Context Relevance, Groundedness, and Answer Relevance. These methods are vital for evaluating the relevance and truthfulness of an LLM's response.
